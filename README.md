## [Transactions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-ledger-api/src/Plutus/V1/Ledger/Tx.hs)

### Tx

> A transaction, including witnesses for its inputs.

```haskell
data Tx = Tx {
    txInputs      :: Set.Set TxIn,
    -- ^ The inputs to this transaction.
    txCollateral  :: Set.Set TxIn,
    -- ^ The collateral inputs to cover the fees in case validation of the transaction fails.
    txOutputs     :: [TxOut],
    -- ^ The outputs of this transaction, ordered so they can be referenced by index.
    txMint        :: !Value,
    -- ^ The 'Value' minted by this transaction.
    txFee         :: !Value,
    -- ^ The fee for this transaction.
    txValidRange  :: !SlotRange,
    -- ^ The 'SlotRange' during which this transaction may be validated.
    txMintScripts :: Set.Set MintingPolicy,
    -- ^ The scripts that must be run to check minting conditions.
    txSignatures  :: Map PubKey Signature,
    -- ^ Signatures of this transaction.
    txRedeemers   :: Redeemers,
    -- ^ Redeemers of the minting scripts.
    txData        :: Map DatumHash Datum
    -- ^ Datum objects recorded on this transaction.
    } deriving stock (Show, Eq, Generic)
      deriving anyclass (ToJSON, FromJSON, Serialise, NFData)
```

`Tx` is the transaction it self. The most important paramaters are `txInputs` and `txOutputs`, which are responsible for actually changing the users wallet, as well as `txSignatures`, that proves the transaction was approved by the affected users, and `txData`, which stores whatever may be important to know about this transaction.

### TxOut

> A transaction output, consisting of a target address, a value, and optionally a datum hash

```haskell
data TxOut = TxOut {
    txOutAddress   :: Address,
    txOutValue     :: Value,
    txOutDatumHash :: Maybe DatumHash
    }
    deriving stock (Show, Eq, Generic)
    deriving anyclass (Serialise, ToJSON, FromJSON, NFData)
```

It is, as the name suggests, a represantation of a transaction output.


### TxOutRef


> A reference to a transaction output. This is a pair of a transaction reference, and an index indicating which of the outputs of that transaction we are referring to.

```haskell
data TxOutRef = TxOutRef {
    txOutRefId  :: TxId,
    txOutRefIdx :: Integer -- ^ Index into the referenced transaction's outputs
    }
    deriving stock (Show, Eq, Ord, Generic)
    deriving anyclass (Serialise, ToJSON, FromJSON, ToJSONKey, FromJSONKey, NFData)
```
It's basically a reference to a transaction output. In that sense, it takes a reference to the transaction it self (it's ID) and an the output index, but it doesn't store the transaction it self, but rather a reference to it.

### TxOutTx

> A 'TxOut' along with the 'Tx' it comes from, which may have additional information e.g. the full data script that goes with the 'TxOut'.

```haskell
data TxOutTx = TxOutTx { txOutTxTx :: Tx, txOutTxOut :: TxOut }
    deriving stock (Show, Eq, Generic)
    deriving anyclass (Serialise, ToJSON, FromJSON)
```

Stores the transaction a transaction output together with the transaction it self, as it may be helpfull to not only know where a transaction output came from, but also explore it's paramaters.

### TxIn

> A transaction input, consisting of a transaction output reference and an input type.

```haskell
data TxIn = TxIn {
    txInRef  :: !TxOutRef,
    txInType :: Maybe TxInType
    }
    deriving stock (Show, Eq, Ord, Generic)
    deriving anyclass (Serialise, ToJSON, FromJSON, NFData)
```

Very simmilarly to `TxOut`, `TxIn` is simply a represantation of a transaction input.

## [Context](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-ledger-api/src/Plutus/V1/Ledger/Contexts.hs)

### ScriptPurpose

> Purpose of the script that is currently running

```haskell
data ScriptPurpose
    = Minting CurrencySymbol
    | Spending TxOutRef
    | Rewarding StakingCredential
    | Certifying DCert
```

The code definition says it all, it's a data type that defines the purpose of the current script. If a script purpose is `Miniting`, then it will need to store the `CurrencySymbol`, which is the hash of the contract that contains the minting policy. If, alternativily, the script purpose is `Spending`, then it should store the [`TxOutRef`](#txoutref), that is: the reference to the ouput of the transaction that will be "spending". The last two ones are not so common.

### TxInfo

> A pending transaction. This is the view as seen by validator scripts, so some details are stripped out.

```haskell
data TxInfo = TxInfo
    { txInfoInputs      :: [TxInInfo] -- ^ Transaction inputs
    , txInfoOutputs     :: [TxOut] -- ^ Transaction outputs
    , txInfoFee         :: Value -- ^ The fee paid by this transaction.
    -- TODO: rename to txInfoMint, but this requires changes in cardano-ledger-specs
    , txInfoForge       :: Value -- ^ The 'Value' minted by this transaction.
    , txInfoDCert       :: [DCert] -- ^ Digests of certificates included in this transaction
    , txInfoWdrl        :: [(StakingCredential, Integer)] -- ^ Withdrawals
    , txInfoValidRange  :: POSIXTimeRange -- ^ The valid range for the transaction.
    , txInfoSignatories :: [PubKeyHash] -- ^ Signatures provided with the transaction, attested that they all signed the tx
    , txInfoData        :: [(DatumHash, Datum)]
    , txInfoId          :: TxId
    -- ^ Hash of the pending transaction (excluding witnesses)
    } deriving (Generic)
```

When validating a transaction inside a contract, it is important to know some information about this transaction, this is what `TxInfo` is used for. In order to make sure, for example, that a token is being minted by someone with permission, the script could verify if any `PubKeyHash` of `txInfoSignatories` is inside the list of allowed users.

### ScriptContext

```haskell
data ScriptContext = ScriptContext{scriptContextTxInfo :: TxInfo, scriptContextPurpose :: ScriptPurpose }
```

`ScriptContext` stores the all the information about a possible transaction, as well as, what it is used for. Both of this actions are handled by `TxInfo` and `ScriptPurpose`, so it is simply a combination of both of this data types.

## [Constraints](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-ledger/src/Ledger/Constraints/TxConstraints.hs)

### TxConstraint

> Constraints on transactions that want to spend script outputs

```haskell
data TxConstraint =
    MustIncludeDatum Datum
    | MustValidateIn POSIXTimeRange
    | MustBeSignedBy PubKeyHash
    | MustSpendAtLeast Value
    | MustProduceAtLeast Value
    | MustSpendPubKeyOutput TxOutRef
    | MustSpendScriptOutput TxOutRef Redeemer
    | MustMintValue MintingPolicyHash Redeemer TokenName Integer
    | MustPayToPubKey PubKeyHash Value
    | MustPayToOtherScript ValidatorHash Datum Value
    | MustHashDatum DatumHash Datum
    deriving stock (Haskell.Show, Generic, Haskell.Eq)
    deriving anyclass (ToJSON, FromJSON)
```

When wanting to create a new transaction, it would be very boring to write it's definition from scratch. Thinking about this, Plutus has helper functions that magically create transactions from scratch. In order to add functionalities, though, this magic functions require constraints. That's what `TxConstraint` is used for. So, for instance, if I want to create a transaction that requires the signature of a trusted user, I could use this function and give a `TxConstraint` of type `MustBeSignedBy` as an argument.

### InputConstraint

```haskell
data InputConstraint a =
    InputConstraint
        { icRedeemer :: a
        , icTxOutRef :: TxOutRef
        } deriving stock (Haskell.Show, Generic, Haskell.Functor)
```

Simmilarly to [`TxConstraint`](#txconstraint), we can create `InputConstraint`s, that, when used with a helper function, basically say "Create an input that follow these conditions: ...".

### OutputConstraint

```haskell
data OutputConstraint a =
    OutputConstraint
        { ocDatum :: a
        , ocValue :: Value
        } deriving stock (Haskell.Show, Generic, Haskell.Functor)
```

[`InputConstraint`](#inputconstraint), but instead of being used to create inputs, is used to create outputs.
